Description: R Package for the analysis of MoTrPAC datasets. 
    The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is

    preliminary characterization of the range of molecular transducers 
    (the "molecular map") that underlie the effects of physical activity 
    in humans.

    QC/QA analysis of datasets generated and submitted by the consortium 
    Chemical Analysis Sites (CAS).
